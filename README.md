# slippi-light
A way for low-end PC users to watch Slippi Replays!
<h1>How it works</h1>
In order to avoid needing to recreate Melee's engine, I used positional data collected by Slippi instead, meaning that this will not be a game, but only a way to watch replays. I did this to save me and the client computer a lot of work.
<h1>Stage info sources</h1>

Worry not, my dear viewer! Simply download the zip of this repository and extract it into its own folder. If you don't have it installed already, install Node.js. Then, navigate to the directory of slippi light by using the command: "cd directory", where directory is the directory of the slippi light folder. Once you have done that, run "npm install" and then "npm start" to run it!
