A way for low-end PC users to watch Slippi Replays!
<h1>How it works</h1>
In order to avoid needing to recreate Melee's engine, I used positional data collected by Slippi instead, meaning that this will not be a game, but only a way to watch replays. I did this to save me and the client computer a lot of work.
